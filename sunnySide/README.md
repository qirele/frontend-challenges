## My process

This is the first project that I built using sass.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS, (scss), partials
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Really proud of this:

```css
header {
  height: 500px;
  background-image: url("../../images/mobile/image-header.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: bottom center;
}
```


### Continued development

Continue focusing on mobile first development, responsive web pages, accessibility and SASS.
